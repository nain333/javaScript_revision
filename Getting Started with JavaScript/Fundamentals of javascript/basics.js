// const , var ,let
// conventions for varable namings
// can use cammelCasing as well as snake_casing
// const is used to declare the conatants that will be remaining constant throughout the code. Below is an example
const PI = 3.14
// It is also a convention to name the const declarations in caps.
// pelase take a note const will not allow you to change the value of the declaration you made once.
// for example : PI = 3.15 isn't allowed, contrary to what was the case while using let
// const declarations must be initialized , uninitialized declarations will not work 
// example: const PI; will not work , you must intialize it to decalre successfuly using const

// var is used to decalre a variable in a global scope.
